# Worthy v. 1 History

## About

The whole process of Worthy v. 2 has started as a revival of the Worthy - Transparent Personal Finance App (iOS) by Kujunda Seda OÃœ. The former was abandoned in about 2017, although still enjoyed by users even 2 years later. With Worthy v. 2 we aim to build on the legacy of the classic app, spread it to more platforms, add new features and streamline the user experience.

From the technical point of view or aim is to use the most modern stack of technologies in the domain of end-user applications.
