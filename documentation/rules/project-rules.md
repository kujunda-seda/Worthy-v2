# Project rules

## Project organization

1. A master version of the project is stored on the GitHub service. The official repository name is "Worthy v.2"
1. The official repository is owned by Kujunda Seda OÃœ - a design bureau, based in Tallinn, Estonia.
1. The official repository is the single _source of truth_ for the project.
1. All other communications related to the project (phone calls, meetings, Slack, emails etc.) are considered secondary. The results of such communications must be saved either as project issues or in project documentation. 

## Documentation rules

1. All project documentation must be stored in GitHub wiki.
1. The only exception to the rule above is the default README.md file, which is stored in the repository root and aims to give an overview of the project to outside users.
1. All project documentation must be in English

## Issues and milestones

1. Issue is created for an indivisible to-do item. Always split complex tasks into smaller indivisible to-do items.
1. Major important stages of the project should be created as GitHub _milestones_.
1. It is possible to skip creating an issue if the time required to implement a fix for the issue is comparable with the time necessary to create an issue ticket on GitHub.
1. Still, if the issue is important enough to be saved in project history, the issue must be created.
